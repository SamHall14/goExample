# goExample
This is a test package for golang because the mactsouk equivalent is not working on later versions

I realized that this is because golang's `go get` system now defaults to modules. Look [that](https://blog.golang.org/go116-module-changes) up.

This only contains an add function to test with modules that are being pushed to the general userbase since the 1.16 update. Learning curve incoming.
